**About this program
  This is a desktop mascot program running under UNIX / X window
  systems.

  With ver1.6.0 or later, MaCoPiX can be avairable also on Microsoft 
  Windows, using Gtk+/Win32 (all Gtk+ libraries are included in Win
  binary version).
  This Windows version is distributed as compiled (binary) package.
  Most of the text in this document describes about MaCoPiX UNIX
  version. So, fo windows, please see Readme-win32.jp (sorry, Japanese
  only, yet).


  This program could be an evolved one from "ActX" (Activate X
  window system).

  Currently, you can make following types of mascots using MaCoPiX.
         - Focus follower (Window sitters : likely ActX)
         - Fix style      (Desktop wappen?)
  Furthermore, you can select with or without a digital clock for
  each types of mascots. So, MaCoPiX can be used as a sort of desktop clock
  applications. (But the clock function could be still poor.)
  And, the biff function is also available for POP/APOP/UNIX local
  spool/qmail Maildir environments.
  At once, users can create mascots and change their settings from GUI
  instead of editing mascot files directly.
  
  Please pay attention that the mascot file of MaCoPiX has no
  compatibility with that of ActX.


**Environment
  Basically, MaCoPiX needs UNIX / X window system or Microsoft Windows.
    [for UNIX]
     - Gtk+        > ver1.2.0   (or Gtk+ > ver2.0.0)
     - gdk-pixbuf  > ver0.7.0   (or Gtk+ > ver2.0.0)
     - libpng .                 (or Gtk+ > ver2.0.0)
     - gettext     > ver0.10   
     are necessary.
     MaCoPiX can be load all image types supported by gdk-pixbuf.
     But, you need libraries to support each types of images
     (ex. libtiff, libpng) in order to load each types of images. 
     The official MaCoPiX mascots are served in PNG files now.

   [for Microsoft Windows (binary package)]
     - Windows2000,XP or later (Still unconfirmed on Vista)
     - Including TAR32.DLL(GPL) in the binary distribution.
        * You can dounload it (free-software, GPL) form the HP of
          "Common Archiver Library Project".
           URL  http://www.csdinc.co.jp/archiver/index-e.html
     - All required libraries (Gtk+ etc.) are also included in the
       binary package. 


**Install (Unix from source)
  1. extract source archive, change directory to the created one.
  2. ./configure 
       ##################################################################
        ./configure options
         [Gtk+] (default is for Gtk+2.x)
           ./configure --with-gtk1      (use Gtk+1.2)
         [Cairo]  (default is on)
           ./configure --disable-cairo  (not use cairo)
         [SSL] (default is OpenSSL)
           ./configure --with-gnutls    (use GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL)
           ./configure --disable-ssl    (none support for SSL)
         [Win32]  (default is for UNIX)
           ./configure --with-win32     (making for Win32)

       ##################################################################
  3. make
  4. su
  5. make install
   (If you need to internationalize your menu message (using gettext),
    you have to do "make install" as a root.)



**How to start
  In anyway, you have to download one mascot file at least (at present).
  Without mascot files, you cannot do anything with MaCoPiX.
  Please download or prepare more than one mascot archive (*.tar.gz) 
  and start macopix.

  With MaCoPiX ver1.6.4 or later, you can install downlocaded mascot
  archives (*.tar.gz) with drag & drop on the running MaCoPiX mascot
  (or on the 1st message window for environment with no installed mascots).

  Just running MaCoPiX,
         % macopix
  After started up, please install mascots with drag & drop (or from GUI).

  If you want to fix the mascot at your startup of MaCoPiX and have a
  mascot file (mascot.mcpx), please run the following command. 
         % macopix mascot.mcpx
  After starting the application, you can change any settings from the
  pop-up GUI.

  And you can see the command line options, using -h (or --help) option.



**Creating files, necessary files
  MaCoPiX needs (and creates) the following files...
    a. Mascot file (*.mcpx)
            And a mascot includes images (and sound files, if necessary).
    b. Resource file (* .rc)
    c. Launcher Menu file (*.menu)

  Basically, these files are copied or created in the "User Directory"
  (HOME$/.macopix/ for each users).

  About a., please see the following item as "Mascots".

  b., the resource file is the file described the parameters kept all
  times regardless of changing mascots.
  If you do not appoint any files for the resource file (you can
  appoint the resource file which you want to load with "-r" option),
  the default one (HOME$/.macopix/macopix.rc) should be loaded.

  c. is the Launcher menu in which your favorite mascots are registered.
  Please see the following item "Launcher menu".
           


**Mascots
  The mascot of MaCoPiX is made up with 
     - a mascot file (*.mcpx)
     - image files   (You can use any image types loaded by
                      gdk-pixbuf)
  likely in the case of ActX.
  Of course, you can use shaped mascots, if you appoint the shaped
  images with alpha values (ex. png, gif, xpm).

  At the starting time of the application, the mascot file should be
  appointed as "% mascot mascot.mcpx".
  In such case, MaCoPiX automatically searches the mascot file
  according to the following priority.
      1. absolute path or relative path from the current directory
      2. User Directory ($HOME/.macopixrc/)
      3. Common Directory (/usr/share/macopix/ ?)
  User directory(2) should be automatically created at the first time
  for using MaCoPiX.
  Distribution Directory(3) will be determined by the installer 
  at the time of installation.

  Image files should be appointed in the mascot file.
  These files are also searched according to the following priority.
      1. same directory where the mascot file exists
      2. User Pixmap Directory ($HOME/.macopixrc/pixmap/)
      3. Common Pixmap Directory (/usr/share/macopix/pixmap/ ?)

  And, if you selected automatic install (option -a; saved in the
  resource file), mascot files are automatically installed at the time
  of loading.
  Starting with the -O (--over-write) option, the priority of loading
  will change to 1 > 3 > 2 in order to overwrite mascots in user 
  directory with ones in the distribution directory installed by
  RPM package etc.

  You should take care of the locale of your system to use mascots.
  Mascot files should be written in one of the locale (in Gtk+1.2).
  If you use the mascot in the different locale environment, balloons
  and menus could not be presented correctly.
  The author of this application will release his mascots in "ja"
  (Japanese-euc) locale. 
  If you interested in them, please translate them for your environment.
  Furthermore, if there is a gettext message file (in po/ directory of
  the source tree) for your environment, you can change the dialog
  messages of GUI into your language.
  When you translated these files, please contact with the author.



**Launcher menu
  In the field "Mascot Launcher" of the po-pup menu, you can register
  your favorite mascot for easy changing.
  To use this function, you have to prepare the launcher menu file (*.menu).
  You can load and create it from the pop-up menu in every time.
  And you can also edit it in the configuration dialog.

  It is difference from the ActX one that the menu file has two levels
  as "Category" -> "Mascot".
  All "Mascots" have to be included in "Categories".

  Each resource file can appoint one menu file as its default menu file.
  If no menu files are appointed at the starting, this default menu
  should be loaded.
  If no mascot files are appointed at that time, a mascot selected at
  random from the menu file should be loaded.
  Furthermore, if you don't the appointment of the default menu in your
  resource file, the menu selection dialog will appear in startup.
  

  If you appoint a menu file at the starting time, please use "-m" (or
  "--menu") option.
 

**Biff function
  MaCoPiX can be a mail checker for the following types of the mail 
  environment.
     1. local spool (UNIX mbox : /var/spool/mail/$USER etc)
     2. POP3 (SSL/TLS)
     3. POP3 (APOP auth) (SSL/TLS)
     4. qmail (Maildir)
     5. MH + Procmail
  After preparing proper configuration, please start MaCoPiX with "-b"
  (or "--biff") option, or please check "Biff Check" on the pop-up
  menu.
  If you use the biff checker in POP, your password are saved in the
  resource file with plain text.
  So, please be careful for the management of the resource files.
  (Basically, the resource files can be seen only by yourself.)

  - for POP3/APOP
    In "Server information" of GUI, input "Address", "UserID", "Password",
    "POP3 Port No."(You should not change it in usual cases.).
    You don't need to edit "File" entry.
    POP over SSL (SSL/TLS) has been supported from ver 1.6.2, 
    experimentally.

  - for qmail (Maildir)
    In "File" entry of "Server information" of GUI, input the
    Maildir directory in which newly arrived mails are stocked
    ( $HOME/Maildir/new in the most of cases ).

  - MH + Procmail
    In "File" entry of "Server information" of GUI, input the
    full-path of log file for procmail, "procmail.log". (In the most
    of cases, this file are appointed in "LGFILE=" entry of
    $HOME/.procmailrc )
    The mail directory for MH is automatically searched as the
    following order, (1) "MAILDIR" entry in $HOME/.procmailrc,
    (2) $HOME/Mail .
    If you want to poll to the mail server periodically via fetchmail
    or something else, you should input command for polling into
    "Polling" entry in "Operating Information of Biff GUI.



**Time signal function
  MaCoPix has a time signal function, which do some actions (external
  command, mascot changing ... etc.) every hour  on the hour (00 minute).
  After preparing proper configuration, please start MaCoPiX with "-s"
  (or "--signal") option, or please check "Time Signal" on the pop-up
  menu.
  The configurations for this function are saved in the resource file.
  "Mascot Random Change" cannot work, if you do not appoint any menu 
  files.
     

**Socket Message
  Now mascots can speak any messages appointed in command line externally.
   1. Start MaCoPiX with --sockmsg option.
      You can start only one mascot at the same time.

   2. From terminal command line, type
       macopix --message "Hello!"
      You can see this message on your mascot balloon.
      You should change character code of the message following your locale.

   3. If you want to change the expiration time to display each socket 
      messages, you can appoint it like this way.
       macopix --message "Hello!" --message-expire 5000
      Using this --message-expire option, you can set the expiration
      time to display each messages (unit is msec).
      Without this option, the default expiration time will be used.
      It can be set on GUI.

   4. In the socket message balloon, you can also use "Stepping mode".
      This mode will set "%c" control character automcatically in your
      sending message. 
      This can be set in GUI and also in command line options to send
      a message.

   5. NEW! Animation messages. 
      In terminal you can type --anim <animation id> to play animation.
      eg. --anim 1
      
      --message option is not needed if you don't want a message.

   6. NEW! Animation looping.
      In terminal you can type --anim-loop <loop count> 
      and current animation will loop specific times. 
      eg. --anim-loop 5

      use -1 to make it repeat, to stop repeat just send again with number 0
      

**Duet Animation
   Using socket communication, some animation can be connected between
   two mascots.
   If you start Sachiko-sama and Yumi at the same time, and click one
   of them....
    - Each mascots makes /tmp/macopix-(userID)/macopix-(mascot file) temporal
      file. If MaCoPiX was stopped abnormally these files can remain,
      but they will not affect the next time.
    - If the two or more same mascot start, the later will use this
      temporal pipe file.
      But, if the former is stopped or changed, this pipe should be closed.



**Nokkari-chara Support
  Now data conversion from/to Nokkari-Chara (an Window sitter
  application for MS Windows) is supported.
  But it is very experimental one and maybe for mascots developers.
  Please read NKR.README.jp in this archive (sorry, only in Japanese).



**Difference between Gtk+2.x / Gtk+-1.2 version
  Now, there are some difference points between Gtk+2.x and Gtk+1.2
  version of MaCoPiX including anti-alias effects in their font display.
    - Character Code
       In Gtk+1.2, you should select same locale as the character code
       in  mascots/menus files for your environment.
       In the case of Gtk+2.x version, the character code of mascot
       file should be understood, according to the following priority.
          1. [General] code=xxxx  setting in .mcpx file
          2. current locale environment
          3. MaCoPiX default (EUC-JP)
       If MaCoPiX cannot understand the character code, you should
       find "Invalid Character Code" display in Gtk+2.x version.
    - Font selection
       Fonts to be selected is difference in each Gtk+ versions.
       If you find any alert, you should select suitable fonts for
       your systems, using the font selection dialog of MaCoPiX.
  Of course, Gtk+2.x version requires much memory area. compared with
  Gtk+1.2 version.


**SSL Support
  This program can compile with a link to OpenSSL or GNUTLS libraries 
  (or without either) to support POP over SSL on its biff function.

  Because OpenSSL is a non-GPL freeware. I have to add a special 
  exception for GPL to link this program with OpenSSL.
  If you feel uneasy about this license issue, please link with GNUTLS.

  You can switch it with ./configure option before compiling.
    - OpenSSL (default)
    - GNUTLS  (./configure --with-gnutls)
    - without SSL  (./configure --disable-ssl)
  When your environment for gnutls development does not satisfy to make
  this program, OpenSSL will be used instead of GNUTLS.
  (I confirmed a build completion with gnutls-1.4.1, but I couldn't with
   gnutls-1.0.2 .)

  In actual operation, GNUTLS version has some different points, compared 
  with OpenSSL ver.
    - GNUTLS does not support SSL v2.
    - GNUTLS ver. always skippes confirmation on SSL certification.
  If you neglect the license matter, I recommend to use OpenSSL rather
  than GNUTLS.


**Tranlucent Windows
  Translucent Panel Clock and Balloon can be used also on UNIX with
  MaCoPiX ver1.7.0 or later.
  To enable this function, you need to compile MaCoPiX with  
    - Gtk+ 2.8 (or later; cairo library is required.) .
  Furthermore, you also need to run MaCoPiX on
   - appropriate Window Mangers supporting translucent window rendering
       (Compiz, Beryl KWin etc.)
           * You should turn ON "Desktop Effects", "Visual Effects" etc. 
  to use this translucent function.
  With Gtk+2.10 or later, MaCoPiX can ditermine your desktop support
  for translucent windows automaticaly. But, with Gtk+2.8, you should
  check "Forced translucent rendering" in the config window (Common->
  Font/Color).

  With non-translucent environment, panel clock and balloon rendered
  by cairo also can be used. The opacities of each colors are
  effective only with cairo rendering. With non-translucent
  environment, cairo will render each parts of clock and balloon over
  a white plane base with translucent colors.
  If the colors of clock and balloon are  different from your
  expectation, you should change opacities of each colors to 255 (100%).

  Mascot and biff images also can be rendered translucently with Cairo
  rendering. 
  Required environment for this function should be same as above.
  In this cairo rendering mode, scaled-down (up) mascots can have
  anti-aliased outline with composited environment. 
  Furthermore, Now "Drop shadow of mascot" option is avairable with
  this mode.
  This mode automatically turns off with non-composited environment
  (Gtk+2.10 or later).

  For Windows version of MaCoPiX, it already has translucent rendering 
  function using Windows native API. So, you are never required any
  special environments.
  In Windows' cairo redndering, opacities of background colors will be
  ignored and used ordinal Balloon/Panel clock opacities instead of it.


**To Do
  - Sockmsg mode for Windows?
  - Enhancement of the clock & alarm  function
         .............
